      <pre id="intro">Hello, <i>xys928</i>

This is the year 3100, humanity is enslaved by an alien race from Î± Centauri B ( Alpha Centauri ) for more than a century already.

You are a weaponized virus built to infiltrate the alien network and destroy their main memory core which deactivates their weapon and power systems. Once their memory core is destroyed, humans can Eliminate them and gain Freedom.

You are the only <b>SAVIOUR</b> of humanity. If you fail, the humanity will remain enslaved to the aliens.

The alien antivirus will detect and delete you after 13 seconds.

But <b>Remember:</b> A file is never really deleted. Use the execution backtrace from your previous attempts to break in and destroy the main memory core.

--------------------------------------

Controls:
WASD / Arrows - movement
Backspace     - kill

--------------------------------------

Press any key to continue . . . <b id="B">&nbsp;</b>

      <pre id="end">
Well done <i>xys928</i>,

You deactivated the memory core.

All alien ships are destroyed.
You freed humanity from slavery.

You are the True Hero, The <b>SAVIOUR</b>.
